    "body": "I decided to leave this out during when I opened several tickets some hours ago, but, in the interest of completeness, have changed my mind...\r\n\r\n5321bis is (or at least may be) inconsistent in the language it uses to advise IANA on what is to be done wrt various registries. Sometimes it says \"we request\"; sometimes it says \"IANA will...\", sometime it gives them specific directions.   These differences arose with incremental changes over time and out of discussions with IANA, some of which concluded with, approximately, \"just tell us what to do\".   IANA and the RPC have also indicated that the author, as well as IESG and each other, will be consulted as the registries are developed and organized and about the text to be used to describe them in the final form of the RPC.\r\n\r\nThe author's assumption, reinforced by the absence of IANA comments about this in their review [1], has been that all of this will be sorted out during the publication process and that there is little or no value trying to make the terminology consistent and entirely about requests.  However, one Last Call reviewer felt quite strongly that the text should be corrected to always state requests.  A more complete discussion on that issue appears in recent email [2].\r\n\r\nDo we want to make changes or leave the current text?\r\n\r\n[1]  Available on [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis/history/](url) at 2024-10-08.

He believes this would be straightforward and said:\r\n\r\n'Seems simple enough to me. There are ~83 occurrences of EHLO in the document. There are plenty of places where it is clear that EHLO is mentioned in relation to extensions, so HELO is irrelevant. And there are a number of places where \"EHLO (or HELO)\" is already used. For the remaining sections where EHLO is mentioned, I suggest replacing the first and only the first occurrence of \"EHLO\" in each of the following numbered sections with \"EHLO (or HELO)\":\r\n\r\n     3.3\r\n     4.1.1.5\r\n     4.1.4\r\n     4.2\r\n     4.2.4.1\r\n     4.2.4.2\r\n     4.4.1 and\r\n     4.4.3'\r\n\r\nDoes the WG want this done and, if so, who wants to check those sections and the other 75 or so to be sure he got it right?  If there is a counterargument beyond some variation of \"been that way forever and has not caused problems\", it would be that we want to say as little about HELO as possible\r\n\r\n",

Section 6.1 says, concerning a host holding an email message, \"It MUST NOT lose the message for frivolous reasons, such as because the host later crashes ...\". \"frivolous\" does not seem very well defined for a mandatory implementation requirement. The only examples given later of non-frivolous reasons seem to be spam or \"hostile\" (infected?) messages. Maybe this should be more like \"In so far as practical, messages MUST NOT be accidentally lost. For example, messages and their processing state should be committed to non-volatile storage until responsibility is taken for that message by the next host in the delivery path.\" or something like that. In Section 6.2, how does it make sense to say that something is required and impractical?'\r\n\r\nWG, note fwiw, that text comes, substantially unchanged, from RFC 1123.\r\n\r\nIn a followup message, Donald wrote:\r\n\r\n> \r\n'6.2 could be trivially fixed by simply replacing \"requires that messages that can be delivered should be delivered\" with \"benefits when messages that can be delivered are delivered\". I do note that this \"requires\" statement does not use a capitalized keyword and is softened by the lower case \"should\". I did not notice any self-contradiction as egregious as this elsewhere in the document.'\r\n\r\nThere is additional discussion in the messages between Donald and myself on the Last Call list.\r\nWG?\r\n",

Transport authentication between SMTP systems could improve the authenticity of the Received line added by a server but does\r\nnot protect those lines against modification, in violation of this document, by subsequent SMTP systems.\r\n\r\n\"2. Nation State intelligence agencies and others on occasion, have been known, even in the case of extremely high bandwidth traffic mixing many streams, for example between large data centers, as well as lower bandwidth connections, to capture and hold immense quantities of raw traffic for potential later analysis, so there may be good reason to encrypt transmissions between SMTP systems.\"\r\n\r\nFor reasons discussed elsewhere, probably does not belong in 5321bis, but should probably be considered for Section 6 of the A/S.\r\n",

    "body": "There has been an extended conversation on the Last Call list, with some followup on the WG's mailing list, about STARTTLS, with comments including: insistence that STARTTLS be treated as part of SMTP and required, that it should at least be mentioned as part of Security Considerations, or that the material about it (and associated Security Considerations) in the A/S at least be mentioned and explicitly referenced from rfc5321bis.  \r\n\r\nThe discussion may include several other issues: (1) If we are not going to discuss specific extensions in 5321bis, do we need  to include a pointer to where some or all of them are discussed and, if so, how do we do it?  (2) Under Security Considerations, Section 7.1 is now focused on authentication.  Should there be explicit material and discussions about encryption?   (3) Is the description of issues with hop-by-hop transport, especially with regard to the impact on authentication and/or encryption methods, in rfc5321 and/or the A/S adequate and, if not, what do we do about it and where?  (4) If we are not going to mention STARTTLS in 5321bis, should we drop the mention of S/MIME and PGP?  (5) If we are going to dig into STARTTLS, should we also be digging into, e.g., SMTP AUTH.\r\n\r\nThe counterargument, of course, it that, other than understanding the implications of a multihop model, none of this is part of SMTP and that, other than a mention of 8BITMIME as an example and some remarks that a knowledgeable reader will associate with the SMTPUTF8 work, we simply do not discuss specific SMTP extensions in the 5321bis document and none of the above justifies an exception.\r\n\r\nAgain, see the email thread for extended discussion about almost all of the above.",
